### Description
This is a simple app that helps you to sign in and check your credentials with the help of the sql database and then calculates your grade and store it to a database. There are two texfields one for the username and the other for the password. In the next frame there are 6 textboxes for entering marks and two textboxes with no editability for viewing the grade and previous grade. There is a logout button and also a generate marks button.
